There's almost a "no shit" aspect to the idea of placing the idea for a set of plans in these files. 

For now, let's focus on what is sought from this page. 

Profile info (Side Column set to the far righthand side of the page)

    Contains
     * Basic Info (Email, Company, Role, isPremium?)


Usage (I see this being divided into 4 quadrants, which for outlining purposes go clockwise starting at the top lefthand)
    
    Quadrant 1 (Usage Statistics)
        * This will be visualized as a pie chart
            - A simple hover effect will reveal the specific usage stats
    
    Quadrant 2 (Upcoming Deadlines)
     * May not be the funnest thing for the users, but it shows them what is forthcoming. 
        - It will prioritze deadlines based on priority/due date
            (If something is high priority but a week out, it will be prioritized over something low priority that's due tomorrow)
        - Details of the tasks, as well as relevant materials in the app will appear on hover

    Quadrant 3 (Teams)
    * This will be impacted based on whether or not a person is a team leader or not
    * At baseline there will be an expandable list of teams in this quadrant that one will be able to expand by clicking a down arrow, and close by clicking an up arrow
        - Should a person be the leader of their team, there will be an icon next to their name, say a king icon, but this is tbd
    * Members of a team will be able to message each other
        - This is not yet needed, so I will not code this out quite yet. 
    
    Quadrant 4 (TBD)
